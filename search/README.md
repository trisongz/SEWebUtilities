# search_engines  

A python library that performs queries to google, bing, yahoo, and other search engines and collects the search results.  
When using Torch, `requests[socks]` is required, which can be installed using the requirements.txt file, as described below.  
Note that web-scraping may be against the TOS of some search engines, and may result in a temporary ban.

## Supported search engines  

Google  
Bing  
Yahoo  
Duckduckgo  
Startpage  
Dogpile  
Ask  
Searx  
Unbubble  
Torch  

## Features  

 - HTTP and SOCKS proxy support.  
 - Collects dark web links with Torch.  
 - Supports advanced search operators: `url:query`, `title:query`, `text:query`.  
 - Creates report files (html, csv). 
 - Easy to add new search engines. You can add a new engine by creating a new class in `search_engines/core/engines.py`, and register it on the `search_engines` dictionary in the same file. The new class should subclass `Search`, and override the following methods: `_selectors`, `_first_page`, `_next_page` and attributes: `_name`, `_base_url`.  
 - Python2 - Python3 compatible.  

## Requirements  

Python 2.7 - 3.7, with [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)  

## Installation  

Copy `search_engines` to your python libraries.  
Install requirements:  `python -m pip install -r search_engines/requirements.txt --upgrade`.  
Done!  

## Usage  

As a library:  

```
from search_engines import *

engine = Google()
results = engine.search("my query")
links = results.links()

print(links)
```

As a CLI script:  

```  
python search_engines/search.py -e google,bing -q "my query" -r html,csv
```
